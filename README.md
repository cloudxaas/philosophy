# CloudXaas Philosophy
How to develop cloudxaas programs and solutions

1. Everything is designed for (eventual) ultimate security, extreme performance, maintainability for **aerospace grade military use** and in A.I.
   (reference NASA coding standard with exception to using "goto", which should be used sparingly.)
2. Everything is written in reusable functions, following modular simple, clean and minimal Unix philosophy.

Coding Style
Reference NASA + Google + Misra + AutoSAR + Linux = CLOUDXAAS coding style.

Let's work out the kinks together!
