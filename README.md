# CloudXaas Philosophy
To enhance app development, we can create "syscall" functions that standardize programs and functions. This can facilitate code reuse and improve program speed.

It has become evident that many functions are being redundantly created across different domains. 
If a global standard for commonly used functions is established, it can bring harmony and coherence to the programming world.

Based on extensive coding experience, most functions are typically balanced between CPU time and memory use. 
As such, we can assign different names to each function based on their CPU efficiency and memory tradeoff, 
such as function-25 for 25% CPU efficiency, function-50 for 50% CPU and memory efficiency, 
function-75 for 75% CPU efficiency and memory tradeoff, while "function" denotes 100% CPU efficiency.

To develop CloudXaaS programs and solutions, we prioritize aerospace military-grade standards for AI, 
ultimate security, extreme performance, and maintainability. 

We write everything in reusable functions, following a modular, simple, clean, and minimal Unix philosophy. 

CloudXaas is always striving to improve, following the coding style of Google, Misra, AutoSAR, NASA, and Linux.
