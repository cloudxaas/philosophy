# CloudXaas Philosophy
We can standardize programs / functions into their own "syscall" functions for app development.
This helps improves code reuse and can make programs run faster.

I realised there are plenty functions out there that are being churned out plenty times all over everywhere.
If the world can come together and united in a common standard for commonly used functions, the world will have peace.

Based on years of experience coding, functions (for now) are mostly balanced between CPU time and memory use.
Therefore each functions can be named function-25 for 25% cpu efficiency trading off memory space
function-50 for 50% cpu and mem efficieny tradeoff function-75 for 75% cpu efficiency and memory tradeoff while "function" means 100% cpu efficiency.

How to develop cloudxaas programs and solutions

1. Everything is written for use in **aerospace military grade for A.I.", 
   ultimate security, extreme performance and maintainability in such sequence. 
2. Everything is written in reusable functions, following modular simple, clean 
   and minimal Unix philosophy.
3. Always getting better.

Google + Misra + AutoSAR + NASA + Linux = CloudXaas
